# IsValid
### About the function
A time series reference specified by **@t(‘TheReference’)** may give no result.
The reason for this may be one of the following:

- **TheReference** does not exist.
- There is no connection to a physical time series from the current context.


In these cases the system displays a warning message in the Nimbus Object
Structure log. The warning message informs it could not resolve **TheReference**
for a given object.

  You may use either IsValid or [Valid](../functions/valid.md) to handle these cases.

### Syntax
- IsValid(t)
- IsValid(s,s)


### Description IsValid(t)


| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| t | >Source time series that is normally the result of a `@t('TheReference')`. |



  The function returns 1 or 0 representing true or false.



### Description IsValid(s,s)


| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| s | Expected type of target, i.e. the entity found from the search/navigation defined in the next argument. Valid target codes are 't', 'd', 's', 'T', 'D' or 'S'. The codes represents time series, numeric, string, time series array, numeric array and string array respectively. |
| s | TheReference - The search/navigation string which defines where to go to find the target entity. |



This variant checks if there is a target of specified type available from the
calculation context. If the target of the expected type is found, then the
function returns 1 (representing true), otherwise the function returns 0. The
function does not produce any log events when lookup fails.
