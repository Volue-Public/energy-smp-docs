# Revision
### About the function
This function generates a time series from the Revision events associated with
this element, filtered on Status. The value will be 1 at the times where there
is an event, and 0 otherwise.

For more information about generating time series from restrictions/revisions,
see the help for the **Smart Power Apps** module **Availability Planner**.**

*Note!*** The generated time series will per default be a breakpoint time
series, unless an explicit transformation to a fixed interval is specified in
the time series calculation.
